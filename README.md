## Data Analysis Phase

### ✨Ask Phase

#### ➤Business Task:

- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
    - Figure out how smart devices can help and guide the marketing strategy for Bellabeat.
    - Figure out what kind of new improvement we can do with one of Bellabeat’s products.
    - Understand how non-Bellabeat consumers use their smart devices.
- How can your insights drive business decisions?
    - Knowing the behavior of how customers use their smart devices will help us identify new opportunities on what is needed to be improved from Bellabeat’s product.
    - Then we can come up with a marketing campaign strategy focusing on the new improvement that has been done with the product.

#### ➤Stakeholders:

### ✨Prepare Phase

#### ➤Data being used:
This dataset was downloaded from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data where it was uploaded by Möbius.

#### ➤Data Summary:
The datasets was published to Kaggle under the CC0: Public Domain Creative Common License. Allowing for the datasets to be copied, modified and distributed without asking for permission.

According to its information, the datasets are generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.  Thirty FitBit users consented to submit their personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Additionally, it was also stated that the difference in the output can be attributed to the use of different Fitbit tracker models and the user’s own ways of tracking their activities.

#### ➤Data Organization:

There are eighteen datasets from the **[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)** and are downloaded in .csv file and with long and wide formats. Data is long because each subject has multiple rows of data, representing a one-time point.

I was able to verify that 33 user has their own unique ID and time length of analysis is 31 days.

#### ➤Data Integrity and Limitations:

The datasets were collected in 2016, which makes them outdated. Moreover, after verifying the data, it only covered a 31-day period (04-12-2016 to 05-12-2016), which is a relatively short timeframe. 

Also, the sample size of 33 may lead to sample bias and limits the ability to make recommendations for a larger population. Furthermore, the lack of demographic information makes it difficult to accurately identify the target audience and provide relevant marketing recommendations. This information would have been helpful for Bellabeat, considering that their primary audience is women and individuals who menstruate.

Getting a more insightful analysis can be relatively small due to various limitations of the datasets.

### ✨Process Phase

I decided to use Excel to clean the datasets and then moved forward to using SQL for analyzing the data further and Tableau for data visualization.  

#### ➤Datasets Selected:

This data was initially selected for data analysis. To ensure the reliability and credibility of our data, we will need to clean and verify each dataset before moving forward to the Analyze Phase.

**dailyActivity_merged**

**dailySteps_merged**

**dailyCalories_merged**

**sleepDay_merged**

**hourlySteps_merged**

**weightLogInfo_merged**
</p>

#### ➤Data Cleaning:

- Formatted Date in mm/dd/yyyy
- Formatted numerical data into Number format with 2 decimal place
- Used Conditional Formatting to check if there are any duplicate values
- Checked if values are consistent by using the `=LEN` function
- Separated Date and Time in the Sleep Day sheet by changing the format to mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM and used flash fills.


*NOTE: Sleep Day has 3 duplicate values and was removed.*


After cleaning the datasets, I wanted to make sure that there is enough data for the analysis. We decided to check if there is enough participants in each dataset. 

```
=SUMPRODUCT(1/COUNTIF(criteria,range))
```

We can see that weightLogInfo_merged does not have enough data to move forward with the analysis.

I did not include dailySteps_merged and dailyCalories_merged as well since the data in it is the same as the data inside the dailyActivity_merged.

You can also use this query in SQL to see total users in each datasets:

```SQL
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT (Id)) as  total_unique_id
FROM
    bellabeat_capstone.dbo.daily_activity;
```

---

### ✨Analyze Phase

#### ➤Tracker Usage Categories:

I wanted to know how consistent did the participants use their tracker for the span of 31 days.

``` SQL
SELECT 
    Id,
    COUNT(ActivityDate) as activity_date
FROM
    bellabeat_capstone.dbo.daily_activity
    GROUP BY Id
    ORDER BY activity_date DESC;
```
<img width="284" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 8 36 16 AM" src="https://github.com/anj-codes/Bellabeat_Capstone/assets/120025904/d3cad860-076c-4477-bab4-d487d88825f2">
</p>
<em>Image from Azure Data Studio</em>
</p>

About 64% of users was able to completely use their tracker for 31 days and 24% of users only missed 1- 5 days. Overall, 88% of users wore their FitBit Tracker consistently for a month long.

Next I wanted to breakdown the users into three criteria based on how often they wear their tracker. I categorized the users as follows:

- **Consistent** - users wore their tracker for 25 -31 days
- **Moderate** - users wore their tracker for 11 - 24 days
- **Sometimes** - users wore their tracker for less than 10 days

``` SQL
SELECT
    Id,
    COUNT(ActivityDate) AS total_tracked,
  CASE 
    WHEN  COUNT(ActivityDate) >=25 THEN 'Consistent'
    WHEN  COUNT(ActivityDate) >= 11 THEN 'Moderate'
    WHEN  COUNT(ActivityDate) <= 10 THEN 'Sometimes'
  END AS wearing_tracker
FROM 
    bellabeat_capstone.dbo.daily_activity
    GROUP BY Id;
```
<img width="437" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 8 38 20 AM" src="https://github.com/anj-codes/Bellabeat_Capstone/assets/120025904/61b9bb16-3fc3-4479-92eb-83c26a561e57">
</p>
<em>Image from Azure Data Studio</em>
</p>
  
Then I want to know how many users are categorized as 'Consistent', 'Moderate', and 'Sometimes’

``` SQL
SELECT 
    wearing_tracker,
    COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM 
(
    SELECT
        Id,
        COUNT(ActivityDate) AS total_tracked,
        CASE 
            WHEN  COUNT(ActivityDate) >=25 THEN 'Consistent'
            WHEN  COUNT(ActivityDate) >= 11 THEN 'Moderate'
            WHEN  COUNT(ActivityDate) <= 10 THEN 'Sometimes'
        END AS wearing_tracker
    FROM bellabeat_capstone.dbo.daily_activity
    GROUP BY Id
) subquery
GROUP BY wearing_tracker;
```

#### ➤User Type per Activity Level:

Since there is no demographic variables to distinct the users from our datasets, I classify the users by their daily steps as their level of activity.

We can classify the users as follows:

- **Sedentary** - Less than 5000 steps a day.
- **Lightly active** - Between 5000 and 7499 steps a day.
- **Fairly active** - Between 7500 and 9999 steps a day.
- **Very active** - More than 10000 steps a day.

In general, the recommended steps daily is 10,000 for adults. But this still depends on the person’s age and fitness level to achieve health benefits according to these articles:

- [How many steps should people take per day?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-many-steps-should-you-take-a-day)
- [Counting Your Steps](https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/healthy-lifestyles/counting-steps/)


```SQL
SELECT
    Id,
    AVG(StepTotal) avg_daily_steps,
    CASE
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) <=5000 THEN 'Inactive user'
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) <=7499 THEN 'Low active user'
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) <=9999 THEN 'Average active user'
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) >=10000 THEN 'Very active user'
        END AS user_type
FROM
    bellabeat_capstone.dbo.daily_steps 
    GROUP BY Id;
```
<img width="452" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 8 56 30 AM" src="https://github.com/anj-codes/Bellabeat_Capstone/assets/120025904/9297be30-2b45-4f27-aa28-ff6ed782cfbf">
</p>
<em>Image from Azure Data Studio</em>
</p>

Then I want to see the breakdown of each classification:

```SQL
SELECT
    user_type,
    COUNT(*) AS user_count
 FROM 
 (
SELECT
    Id,
    AVG(StepTotal) avg_daily_steps,
    CASE
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) <=5000 THEN 'Inactive user'
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) <=7499 THEN 'Low active user'
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) <=9999 THEN 'Average active user'
        WHEN AVG(StepTotal) >=10000 THEN 'Very active user'
        END AS user_type
FROM
    bellabeat_capstone.dbo.daily_steps 
    GROUP BY Id
 ) subquery
 GROUP BY user_type;
```
<img width="321" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-16 at 8 57 50 AM" src="https://github.com/anj-codes/Bellabeat_Capstone/assets/120025904/b69d755d-1604-4055-bcbd-a4c60d2c4221">
</p>
<em>Image from Azure Data Studio</em>
</p>

If we will split the results into two, we can say that 17 users are “Non - Low active” and 16 users are considered “Active”.
