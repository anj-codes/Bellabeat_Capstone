## Data Analysis Phase

### âœ¨Ask Phase

#### Business Task:

- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
    - Figure out how smart devices can help and guide the marketing strategy for Bellabeat.
    - Figure out what kind of new improvement we can do with one of Bellabeatâ€™s products.
    - Understand how non-Bellabeat consumers use their smart devices.
- How can your insights drive business decisions?
    - Knowing the behavior of how customers use their smart devices will help us identify new opportunities on what is needed to be improved from Bellabeatâ€™s product.
    - Then we can come up with a marketing campaign strategy focusing on the new improvement that has been done with the product.

#### Stakeholders:
1. **UrÅ¡ka SrÅ¡en**Â â€“ Bellabeatâ€™s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
2. **Sando Mur**Â â€“ Mathematician and Bellabeatâ€™s cofounder
3. **Bellabeatâ€™s marketing analytics team**Â â€“ a team of data analytics

### âœ¨Prepare Phase

#### Data being used:
This dataset was downloaded from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data where it was uploaded by MÃ¶bius.

#### Data Summary:
The datasets was published to Kaggle under the CC0: Public Domain Creative Common License. Allowing for the datasets to be copied, modified and distributed without asking for permission.

According to its information, the datasets are generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.  Thirty FitBit users consented to submit their personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Additionally, it was also stated that the difference in the output can be attributed to the use of different Fitbit tracker models and the userâ€™s own ways of tracking their activities.

#### Data Organization:

There are eighteen datasets from the **[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)** and are downloaded in .csv file and with long and wide formats. Data is long because each subject has multiple rows of data, representing a one-time point.

I was able to verify that 33 user has their own unique ID and time length of analysis is 31 days.

#### Data Integrity and Limitations:

The datasets were collected in 2016, which makes them outdated. Moreover, after verifying the data, it only covered a 31-day period (04-12-2016 to 05-12-2016), which is a relatively short timeframe. 

Also, the sample size of 33 may lead to sample bias and limits the ability to make recommendations for a larger population. Furthermore, the lack of demographic information makes it difficult to accurately identify the target audience and provide relevant marketing recommendations. This information would have been helpful for Bellabeat, considering that their primary audience is women and individuals who menstruate.

Getting a more insightful analysis can be relatively small due to various limitations of the datasets.

### âœ¨Process Phase

I decided to use Excel to clean the datasets and then moved forward to using SQL for analyzing the data further and Tableau for data visualization.  

#### Datasets selected:

This data was initially selected for data analysis. To ensure the reliability and credibility of our data, we will need to clean and verify each dataset before moving forward to the Analyze Phase.

dailyActivity_merged

dailySteps_merged

dailyCalories_merged

sleepDay_merged

hourlySteps_merged

weightLogInfo_merged

#### Data cleaning:

- Formatted Date in mm/dd/yyyy
- Formatted numerical data into Number format with 2 decimal place
- Used Conditional Formatting to check if there are any duplicate values
- Checked if values are consistent by using the `=LEN` function
- Separated Date and Time in the Sleep Day sheet by changing the format to mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss AM/PM and used flash fills.


NOTE: Sleep Day has 3 duplicate values and was removed.


After cleaning the datasets, I wanted to make sure that there is enough data for the analysis. We decided to check if there is enough participants in each dataset. 

```
=SUMPRODUCT(1/COUNTIF(criteria,range))
```

We can see that weightLogInfo_merged does not have enough data to move forward with the analysis.

I will not be including dailySteps_merged and dailyCalories_merged as well since the data in it is the same as the data inside the dailyActivity_merged.

You can also use this query in SQL to see total users in each datasets:

```SQL
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT (Id)) as  total_unique_id
FROM
    bellabeat_capstone.dbo.daily_activity;
```
